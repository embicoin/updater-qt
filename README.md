updater-qt
==========

My (next ;) try for an updater an mod system, this time porting ruler501's python script to C++/Qt

Ignore the directory, it contains a preview with a gui I suggested once, but is not really functional for now.

The other two files are my partly ported updater logic. I stayed quite close to the original (only dont like foreach{} that much).
Note the run-/writeClient/-Server functions, they are quite the best part :P
